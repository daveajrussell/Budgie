# Budgie
A simple budgeting app.

A pretty rough WIP right now. 

I decided I wanted a budgeting app, I didn't want to pay for YNAB and spreadsheets just weren't cutting it anymore. 

TODO;

## API layer
- Get CORS working properly in the API
- Actually write the API

## Auth layer
- Complete migration to CoreUI (Management pages and main layout)

## App layer
- Begin migration to CoreUI
- Actually write the App
